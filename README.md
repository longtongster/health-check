# health-check

This repository is from a course on automation with python from google. 

It contains a python file, a notebook and probably most important is the cheat_sheet file that bundles important commands that are useful. 

It is important to NEVER REMOVE THIS REPOSITORY

This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks

Now it is time for :coffee: or a :banana:. Maybe even a :sandwich:
