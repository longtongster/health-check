Overview of commands to work with remote repositories

git clone <url>  : creates a copy of a remote repository

git push : pushes local commits to the remote repository

git pull : pulls the latest version from the remote repository.

If changes are made to the local and remote repositories you have to solve potential
merge conflicts.

In order to prevent to be asked for credentials every pull or push you can use:
git config --global credential.helper cache
